+please create a webiste, just a mind map, when i hover over a line (that is an oval around words), a + appears and i can create a new branch to the mind map, add other useful features too, no UI, just the mindmap and functions for it

+make the screen dragable to move around, the root oval should be in the center of the screen

+make the nodes a bit bigger and when you click on a node, you can edit a text, keep the function to add new nodes when pressing the plus that appears on hover

# 2024-11-01 09:32:18.378639
+make the nodes dragable too, which automatically makes the lines change to still connect the nodes, also make the lines not touch the words but the oval

+remove the dragable function, make the plus button appear on the line of the node and when you click on the text of the node you can edit a node, make the popup not a browser popup but design your own

# 2024-11-01 09:46:43.653034
+make the nodes dragable (make it different from before)

# 2024-11-01 09:48:01.410499
+the dragging is very weird, it zooms away when i move

# 2024-11-01 09:49:53.910737
+amazing thank you, make a saving system, in a json, so if the user adds nodes then reloads the site it shows the existing nodes already.

# 2024-11-01 09:53:20.179810
+make it when you press enter while the popup is shown, it does the same save function as when pressing save

+(dont implement this) give suggestions how to make it better

# 2024-11-01 09:58:53.416108
+add numbers: 1, 2, 4(also make a little legend at the bottom left for the shortcuts, the legend should be expandable and retractable), add a button for 9, 18, KEEP EVERYTHING WITH SIMPLE HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT, you can use libraries but dont do any backend (no big database)

+you went too far back, keep the node moving and the custom popup and all that from before, so the files are the way they were when i asked you fro suggestions without implementing them

# 2024-11-01 10:56:06.449143
+make the nodes a bit bigger and the lines connect to the node outlines instead of the text, make a custom popup when you press on a node to edit or delete it or when creating a new one

+make an additional plus button (different color) to add lines/connectors so when you press it you can create a new line between the node that was selected and then user has to click a different node to create a new line, those should also be saved

# 2024-11-01 11:07:56.621520
+make it when user clicks on a connector th choice to delete it
